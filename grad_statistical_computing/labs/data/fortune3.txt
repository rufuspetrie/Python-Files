Don’t behave with cold manners. 
Don’t forget you are always on our minds.
Fortune not found? Abort, Retry, Ignore.
Help! I am being held prisoner in a fortune cookie factory.
It’s about time I got out of that cookie.
Never forget a friend. Especially if he owes you.
Never wear your best pants when you go to fight for freedom.
Only listen to the fortune cookie; disregard all other fortune telling units.
