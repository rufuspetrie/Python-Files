The fortune you seek is in another cookie.
A closed mouth gathers no feet. 
A conclusion is simply the place where you got tired of thinking.
A cynic is only a frustrated optimist.
A foolish man listens to his heart. A wise man listens to cookies.
You will die alone and poorly dressed.
A fanatic is one who can't change his mind, and won't change the subject.
If you look back, youâ€™ll soon be going that way.
