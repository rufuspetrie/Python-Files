You will live long enough to open many fortune cookies.
An alien of some sort will be appearing to you shortly.
Do not mistake temptation for opportunity.
Flattery will go far tonight.
He who laughs at himself never runs out of things to laugh at.
He who laughs last is laughing at you.
He who throws dirt is losing ground. 
Some men dream of fortunes, others dream of cookies.
