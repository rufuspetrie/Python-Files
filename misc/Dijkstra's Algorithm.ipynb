    "The file contains an adjacency list representation of an undirected weighted graph with 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. Each row consists of the node tuples that are adjacent to that particular vertex along with the length of that edge. For example, the 6th row has 6 as the first entry indicating that this row corresponds to the vertex labeled 6. The next entry of this row \"141,8200\" indicates that there is an edge between vertex 6 and vertex 141 that has length 8200. The rest of the pairs of this row indicate the other vertices adjacent to vertex 6 and the lengths of the corresponding edges.\n",

    "Your task is to run Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on this graph, using 1 (the first vertex) as the source vertex, and to compute the shortest-path distances between 1 and every other vertex of the graph. If there is no path between a vertex and vertex 1, we'll define the shortest-path distance between 1 and  to be 1000000.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should report the shortest-path distances to the following ten vertices, in order: 7,37,59,82,99,115,133,165,188,197. Enter the shortest-path distances using the fields below for each of the vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: This graph is small enough that the straightforward  time implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm should work fine. OPTIONAL: For those of you seeking an additional challenge, try implementing the heap-based version. Note this requires a heap that supports deletions, and you'll probably need to maintain some kind of mapping between vertices and their positions in the heap."
